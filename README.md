# DROPORAMA-Cab-Service-Project

DROPORAMA is a user defined input system which is based on the car service transportation application called Uber. Although Uber was made in Node.js and Python, I wanted to make it in C. 
This program takes input from the user about his name, then asks the user about what kind of specific ride class you want to choose. The user gets 5 choices GO, GO+ and of course BUISNESS class. The given car options would be randomly taken by the programâ€™s algorithm depending on the class chosen at the start.
